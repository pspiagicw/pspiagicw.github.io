&lt;h2&gt;Blog Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="making-a-blog-is-hard"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making a blog is hard!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of preparation for a stable SSG system is crazy!
Well SSG stands for Static Site Generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They allow anyone to have a solid and efficient way of writing blogs.
The biggest problem being , which to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are huge , some are written in other languages , some are discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well right now I am using &lt;em&gt;Nikola&lt;/em&gt; . It is a python based SSG which worked well enough for me.
I intend to push this to GitHub but I cannot promise it will happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well if you are reading it , it has already happened , or has it?
Writing from this perspective , anything can happen.This post can just be a RST document in my system or this can be read by anyone acessing the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever may happen , I have already read it which means the post will die with me irrespective of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Neil already saw the moon. It did not matter whether NASA showed it to everyone , the sight would always be in Neil's neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough talking , I have to try posting this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
