* Write a blog they said

** Read a book!
  I love reading technical books which are non-serious , and cater towards casual learners.It provides the most honest perspective for anyone reading.
  Well the most recent one was _Grokking Deep Learning_ , which provides excellent intro to the world of Deep Learning

  The end of that book suggests to improve our knowledge,understanding of Deep Learning , by starting a blog about Deep Learning.

  *Well* I can't deny the idea , I am very scared to execute it , a blog about Deep Learning , a topic almost anyone can understand from a few [[https://google.com][Google]] Sessions.
  
  Now that I have started a blog , this post might be the perfect session to start Deep Learning blogs.I can throw a little Machine Learning in there,
  it would have a lot of coding.I have no idea how this will turn out.
  
  If it's bad , then you might be the rare people who read it , or if it's good you might be not so alone afterall.

  Anyway let's start the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor][Raptors]].
  
** Machine Learning

*** Getting Started

   Well I could start with the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning , or I can start giving code , along with explanations.

   I think I will go with the latter.
   
   For getting started , we need some Packages , Python Packages.Most of Machine Learning is done in Python , it is easy , readable and has good ecosystem.
   Well if you are starting with Python, you can learn it and come to this later.

   Well we need to install Python Packages using _[[https://pypi.org/project/pip/][pip]]_. Well don't worry it comes with almost all Python installations.The packages we need are
   
   1. Numpy: Numerical-Python, provides base for writing mathematical/scientific based code.
   2. Matplotlib: Graphing tool , provides way to create complex graph and heatmaps.
   3. Sklearn: Sckit-leaern , the base on which Machine Learning exists.
   4. Pandas: Tool to interact with tabular data(CSV,XLSX,etc).
      
   I am coding on a generic GNU/Linux distribution , any commands/code I write will work on all platforms  provided you have Python on your PATH variable.
   For installing above packages use the _pip_ command.

   Now that we have packages installed,let's create a new python file and begin.People wanting to use Jupyter Notebook etc, don't judge me!
   
*** Data Collection

   We need to have data to start Machine Learning.Lucky for us _sklearn_ already includes some datasets.
   A dataset is a collection of tabular data along with information on source of the data.
   
   We are going to use moons dataset , it is a simple dataset , it tries to give data about two intersecting circles(Moons!).
   To use it we have to invoke ~make_moons()~ method from ~sklearn.datasets~.
   
   [[img-url:/images/make-moons.png]]

   It returns a tuple with first field being the input data(Data we know) and second field being output data(Data we want to know about).
   Here we want to predict whether the circles intersect or not, given their position.
   
   Let's divide it into input and output variables.
   
   [[img-url:/images/divide-input.png]]
   
*** Training

   We will use K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, it's internal working will be explained later.The important thing , being it is used to Classify.First let's import it.
   It is provided in ~sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier~ .

   [[img-url:/images/import-neighbors.png]]
   
*** Testing

   Using this model is easy , for training call the _fit_ method and testing use the _score_ method.Don't worry about why and what we are doing here!
   Using the score method gives us accuracy , which will tell how good our model is. /Higher the Better!/
   
   Tough we are not using ~score()~ method today , cause we don't have any testing data!!

   [[img-url:/images/train-score-knn.png]]
   
   But we can make predictions for ourselves, as the model is trained on the data , it can make accurate predictions , without any problem.
   To make predictions we use the ~predict~ method.We can pass data is same way input has in an array of two numbers , which can be used which can be used to predict if they are parameters of an intersecting circle.

** Farewell!

Let us meet again in the next post where we will learn more about Machine Learning in general.We will have a lot of fun, so don't miss it!

_Bye for now_
