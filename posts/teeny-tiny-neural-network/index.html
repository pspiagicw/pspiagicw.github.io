We have discussing Machine Leanring algorithms for quite along time here.While Machine Learning algorithms are very powerful , they suffer from the bias/variance problem.
Either model considers data to be in some predetermined form (Linear , Quadratic , Exponential) or predictions are highly dependent on training data itself(Bayes , Nearest Neighbors , DecisionTree).
</p>

<p>
Thus <i>bias</i> can be said to be assumptions about the data before training and <i>variance</i> is effect of changing dataset on model.We need something that is flexible to have no assumptions about the data
and something that does not get affected by change in dataset.Something that can generalize to any data irrespective of it's form.

Neural Network is comes to the rescue.If you have not heard about NN then you must be living under a rock!
</p>

<p>
Neural Networks work on any data(Image , Words , Sound) and can do interesting things , such as create faces , scripts and even art!.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05980a7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org05980a7">How do they work?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org05980a7">
<p>
Their fundamentals lie in the fact of using large number of small models in conjuction.A typical 3 node network contain  5 mini-models within itself.
This also mean all those mini-model's can work in parallel(More on that later).It can also learn to ignore some of them based on condition.
Multiple models also means it can support multiple input and outputs.It does not have any closed-form solution , thus supports online learning.
</p>

<p>
From above words it seems like Neural Network are work of magic.Let's make one and burn it to the ground.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2c2906f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2c2906f">Predict , Error and Learn.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2c2906f">
<p>
We need to have some input and some output (Atleast of supervised learning) .Let's have a simple input of 8 and output of 80.
</p>

<p>
As we discussed before every Neural Network has mini-models , we call these mini-models <i>Nodes</i> , every node has a list of weights , whose length depends on no of input.
</p>

<p>
Here we are making a single node NN , thus we need a single Node with a single weight(As no of input is just one).
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>
   <span class="nb">input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
   <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">80</span>
   <span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
For prediction , we simply do a dot product of weights and inputs , for above situation that means simply multiplying input and weight.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">prediction</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">input</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Error is the difference between our prediction and actual output , for now let's take a absolute difference between them.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prediction</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You might feel we can use this to improve the model , in reality error is for us humans to see.The model uses something called loss to improve itself.
</p>

<p>
The difference being that loss can be hard to understand by humans(Like cross-entropy) , but more accurately represent our data.It is possible for loss and error to be the same thing.
Here loss is difference between prediction and output.Why?
</p>

<p>
Cause we need to take into account wether our prediction was higher than our output or not.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">loss</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">prediction</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">output</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Learning is the most hardest part of Neural Network . It requires to find out how much error was contributed by every specific weight and use it accordingly.In our case we had only one weight.
</p>

<p>
It's contribution to the error is the partial differentiation of loss and itself.Your calculus class is helpful here , for more help regarding partical differentiation look here.
Calculus and algebra are very useful for getting down and dirty with Deep Learning.
</p>

<p>
For now let me tell you the answer! The partial differentiation of loss and our weight is input.In other words if you change weight by 1 , loss will change by input.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the change in weight should be <i>loss/*/input</i>.We are multiplying by loss to take loss into effect too(If no loss , don't change anything).
</p>

<p>
There is another problem , we can't change weight rigourously as it may cause weights to fluctuate , instead we need to make small changes over large iterations.So we use something call learning rate.
We simply have to multiply it with our change.
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">learning_rate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.00001</span>
   <span class="n">change</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">loss</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">learning_rate</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We have to do this multiple times to make some  actual effect.The num of times we have to do this is called epochs , smaller the training data , larger the no of epochs.
</p>

<p>
Here the no of epochs is arbitary and based on trial and error.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">epochs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100000</span>
   <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">epochs</span><span class="p">):</span>
       <span class="n">prediction</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">input</span>
       <span class="n">loss</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">prediction</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">output</span>
       <span class="n">change</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">loss</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">learning_rate</span>
       <span class="n">weight</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">change</span>
   <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The final weight must be near to 10 , if less try increasing no of epochs , or else decreasing value of learning<sub>rate</sub>. High learning rate simply drives weight away from it.

Try to experiment with some input and output values. If it works, Great! . Else our model is very small and simple to capture that data.
