Blog Dilemma
**************
Making a blog is hard!
--------------------------
The amount of preparation for a stable SSG system.
Well SSG stands for Static Site Generators.

They allow anyone to have a solid and efficient way of writing blogs.
The biggest problem being , which of them to choose.

Some are huge , some are written in other languages , some are discontinued.

Well right now I am using *Nikola* . It is a python based SSG which worked well enough for me.
I intend to push this to GitHub but I cannot promise it will happen!

Well if you are reading it , it has already happened , or has it.
Writing from this perspective , anything can happen , this post can just be a RST document in my system or this can be read by anyone acessing the internet.

Whatever may happen , I have already read it which means the post will die with me irrespective of the outcome.

Just like Neil already saw the moon. It did not matter whether NASA showed it to everyone , the sight would already have been within Neil's memory.

Enough talking , I have to try posting this.
